# systemd-cryptsetup-mod
**Automatically unlocking additional Truecrypt or Luks volumes during boot, without asking password twice.**

The solution was tested on <b>Fedora 24  64-bit</b>. <br>
Additional containers should have the same passwords as an encrypted root.

 - Download systemd form https://github.com/systemd/systemd.     Use
    `Clone or download` button.
    
 - Unpack downloaded archive and compile it.     You have to do all
    standard steps like configure, install missing libraries and finally
    make.     Donâ€™t be afraid. We need only one application, not the
    entire systemd.
    
 - In a text editor open file `cryptsetup.c` located in
    `systemd-master/src/cryptsetup/` directory.    
    Modify it, like I did in this github repository: <br>
    	https://github.com/appdevsw/systemd-cryptsetup-mod/commits/master/cryptsetup.c.<br>
    There are two pieces of code between lines
        
	>    //---------------- new code begin     
	>
	>   //---------------- new code end

    Copy and paste these fragments to your edited file in the right places.<br>

 - Run make again. After a successful compilation we need two files
    from `.libs` subdirectory: 
    
    > systemd-cryptsetup	 	
    > libsystemd-shared-230.so
   
    Check if they are there.

 - **Next commands should be executed as root.**

       

 - Create a new file in `/etc` directory, named `crypttab-other.conf`.  
    The file will contain the information about additional encrypted
    containers.     Each line should have 4 words:<br>
           (1) First word from the `/etc/crypttab` file. This is usually the symbol of an encrypted root.<br>
           (2) `truecrypt` or `luks`<br>
           (3) Path to  device/partition thet should be unlocked<br>
           (4) Mount point<br>

	>            Example: 	 
	>               lvm_crypt   truecrypt   /dev/sda3   mytc
	
	>            It means: 
	>               Unlock the truecrypt partition /dev/sda3 
	>               with the same password as lvm_crypt 
	>               and mount it as /dev/mapper/mytc

 - Now we have 3 files and we need them inside `initramfs` image, which is
   used to boot our system.     We have to create a new `initramfs` using
   `dracut` utility and force the `dracut` to include our files.

   

 - Include `crypttab-other.conf` into `initramfs` :<br>
	   Edit `/usr/lib/dracut/dracut.conf.d/01-dist.conf` and modify the line with `install_optional_items` adding a reference to our  `crypttab-other.conf` file. <br><br>
             example: 
               
	> install_optional_items+=" vi /etc/virc ps grep cat rm
	> /etc/crypttab-other.conf"

 - Include `systemd-cryptsetup` and `libsystemd-shared-230.so` into
   initramfs : <br>   
	   a) Copy  `libsystemd-shared-230.so` to `/usr/lib64/`
   directory. <br>
         In my case it was a new file, so adding it to `/usr/lib64` should not cause any harm.<br>    
		b) Make a copy of the current existing file
   `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-cryptsetup`
   

	> cd /usr/lib/systemd/<br>
	> cp ./systemd-cryptsetup ./systemd-cryptsetup.copy


   c) Replace `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-cryptsetup` with our file from `.libs`
   subdirectory
    

	>cp (*our compilation dir*)/.libs/systemd-cryptsetup /usr/lib/systemd/

 
 - Create new initramfs:           
	>     dracut -f
	
     After this command check the `/boot` directory. There should be a file                 `initramfs(kernel version).img` with the current modification time.<br>    
     You can use `lsinitrd` utility to display the  content of the `initramfs` and check if our files are there.
     
 - Restart the system and check if your devices are unlocked.
     
    

	> ls /dev/mapper/*

    You can automatically mount unlocked devices using fstab.
     
 - Remember, that these modifications will remain unchanged only to
   the next `systemd` upgrade.<br>
       In this case you have to replace `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-cryptsetup` with your modified version again.<br>
       Do you need to download and compile the systemd again? It's up to you.
